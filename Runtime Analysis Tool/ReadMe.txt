This program is a runtime performance analyzer, created to:

1. Generate lists of random integers
2. List size will be specified by user at run-time
3. Range of integer values will be specified by user at run-time
4. Run the sort functions on the generated list of integers
5. Calculate and display the time it took to run each function
6. Allow for multiple runs


1. Make sure you have Anaconda/Miniconda 3 installed in your computer as the script only runs in python command prompts
2. Make sure that all 2 files (demos.py, analyzer.py) are in the same directory before running the program
